Credit Scoring Business Understanding:

1. How does the Basel II Accord’s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?
The Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to hold capital reserves proportional to the level of credit risk they take on. It emphasizes three pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review, and market discipline. This regulatory framework mandates that credit risk models must be transparent, interpretable, and auditable to ensure that risk assessments are well-founded and not black-box decisions.

As such, our credit scoring model must:

Be interpretable by risk officers and auditors.

Provide clear documentation on how predictions are made.

Justify predictions with human-readable features and metrics.

Be robust and explainable enough to pass regulatory scrutiny.

This makes models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) attractive for regulated environments due to their simplicity and traceability.

2. Since we lack a direct "default" label, why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the potential business risks of making predictions based on this proxy?
In our dataset, there is no explicit label for whether a customer defaulted on a loan. This is common when working with alternative data sources such as transaction histories. Therefore, we must define a proxy variable that estimates the likelihood of default based on observable behavior — for example, users who exhibit poor RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) patterns or suspicious refund/fraud behaviors.

However, relying on a proxy introduces business risks, including:

Bias and noise: The proxy may not perfectly correlate with true default behavior.

Fairness concerns: Proxies may inadvertently encode socio-economic or behavioral biases.

Poor generalization: If the proxy doesn't reflect real-world defaults, the model may underperform in production.

Regulatory exposure: If the model is challenged, we must prove that our proxy variable is a valid representation of credit risk.

Thus, the choice of proxy must be carefully validated using business intuition and data-driven metrics.

3. What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model (like Logistic Regression with WoE) versus a complex, high-performance model (like Gradient Boosting) in a regulated financial context?
Aspect	Logistic Regression + WoE	Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Interpretability	High	Low
Performance	Moderate	High
Regulatory Compliance	Easy to audit	Difficult to justify
Speed	Fast to train/deploy	Slower, more resources
Deployment Complexity	Low	High
Handling of Nonlinearity	Poor	Excellent

In regulated financial contexts, simplicity and auditability often outweigh marginal performance gains. Logistic Regression with WoE:

Allows domain experts to easily inspect feature influence.

Ensures model behavior remains transparent to regulators.

Can be documented and explained in detail during model governance reviews.

On the other hand, Gradient Boosting may yield better predictive performance but at the cost of explainability, especially if feature contributions aren’t clearly visible (even with SHAP or LIME). The best practice may involve training both types of models and assessing their trade-offs collaboratively with stakeholders and compliance teams.
